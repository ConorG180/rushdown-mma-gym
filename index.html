            <p>
                Rushdown MMA was established in 2007 after formerly being known as Full Circle Martial Arts Academy. In
                2005, ex Bellator fighter Steve O' Neill became one of Ireland’s first professional Mixed Martial Arts
                (MMA) fighters competing in the UK, Europe and South Africa. Coach Steve went on to became Ireland’s
                first European BJJ Champion in ­­­­2008 and became Ireland’s first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu blackbelt after
                being promoted in 2009. Here at Rushdown, we dont solely focus on MMA, but also its core elements, such
                as Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, muay thai, wrestling, boxing, and yoga.
