# Rushdown 
The sport of mixed martial arts has exploded in popularity in recent years. It is clear that there is a growing demand to participate and learn about the sport. Various famous fighters have emerged from Ireland in the past few years, including "The Notorious" Conor Mcgregor, along with other reputable fighters such as Normin Parke and Joe Duffy. Rushdown MMA attempts to supply this demand and offer everyone from MMA enthusiasts to professional UFC stars a place to train and improve upon their technique. This project aims to create a website for the company, and showcase how it can help the MMA community improve their skills, fitness and technique.
